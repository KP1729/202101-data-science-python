### Obtaining Course Materials

The course materials will be updated throughout the course, so we recommend that you download the most recent version of the materials before each lecture or recap session. The latest notebooks and other materials for this course can be obtained by the following these steps:

1. Go to the github page for the course: https://github.com/semacu/data-science-python

3. Click on the **Download ZIP** option in the drop-down menu, and a zip file containing the course content will be downloaded to your computer:

4. Move the zip file to wherever in your file system you want the course materials to be held e.g. your home directory

5. Decompress the zip file to get a folder containing the course materials. Depending on your operating system, you may need to double-click the zip file, or issue a command on the terminal. On Windows 10, you can right click, click **Extract All...**, click **Extract**, and the folder will be decompressed in the same location as the zip file
